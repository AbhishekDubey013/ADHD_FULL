1. functional component we use over class based component due to performance and using hooks we can achieve its all functionality

2. binding component in export const Button = (props)

using this approach we can export multiple subcomponent through a single file

export const Button = () => {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
};

export const Text = () => {
  return <p>Hello, world!</p>;
};

and import it accordingly

import { Button, Text } from './components';

Now you can use Button and Text components
<Button />
<Text />

*******Basically these all will be classes and when u call them with parameters u will be making there object or also called as their instances
